        <h3>üìñ Reading Passage:</h3>
        <p>The Great Wall of China is one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history. Built over several dynasties, this massive structure stretches approximately 13,171 miles across northern China. Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is not a single continuous wall but rather a series of walls, trenches, and natural barriers built by different Chinese dynasties over more than 2,000 years.</p>
        
        <p>The earliest sections were constructed during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) under Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who unified China and connected existing walls to protect against northern invaders. However, most of the wall that exists today was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE). The Ming rulers constructed the wall using stone, brick, and tamped earth, creating a formidable barrier that could reach heights of up to 25 feet.</p>
        
        <p>Despite its massive size, the Great Wall was not always effective in preventing invasions. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan, successfully breached the wall in the 13th century. However, the wall served multiple purposes beyond defense, including border control, trade regulation, and as a symbol of Chinese power and engineering prowess.</p>
        
        <p>Today, the Great Wall is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Millions of people travel to China each year to walk along sections of this ancient wonder, marveling at the engineering skill and determination of the people who built it.</p>
