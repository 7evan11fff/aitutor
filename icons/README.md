# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator. The icons should:

1. Be square (same width and height)
2. Have a transparent background
3. Be clear and recognizable at small sizes
4. Represent the AI Tutor concept (e.g., graduation cap, book, or brain icon)

## Recommended Tools

- [Figma](https://figma.com) - Free design tool
- [Canva](https://canva.com) - Online design platform
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) - Free image editor
- [Paint.NET](https://paint.net) - Windows image editor

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel images as placeholders. The extension will work without proper icons, but they improve the user experience.
