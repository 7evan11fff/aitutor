## üé® Adding Icons Later (Optional)

To add proper icons to your extension:

1. Create three PNG files in the `icons/` folder:
   - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
   - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

2. Add this to your `manifest.json` before the closing `}`:
   ```json
   ,
   "icons": {
     "16": "icons/icon16.png",
     "48": "icons/icon48.png",
     "128": "icons/icon128.png"
   }
   ```

3. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
